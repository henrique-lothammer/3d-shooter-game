## :computer: General info
 A prototype boiler-plate for a 3d top down twin stick shooter game in Unity.
 I made with a composition architecture in C#, so there are very reusable scripts to:
- player movement
- player input keyboard and joystick (default input system)
- weapon controller
- enemy IA follow
- enemy IA attack
